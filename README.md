# responsive_burger
basic responsive hamburger icon with no graphics

Burger animates to an 'X' when selected.
Can be used to trigger menu slides.
Totally scalable and stylable with CSS.

# The Goal

To create an animated hamburger icon that toggles to an 'X' and back.

## 2022-0223 - GOING IN A NEW DIRECTION

I'm refactoring the HTML so the burger is part of a button and semantically correct.
