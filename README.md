# responsive_burger
basic responsive hamburge icon with no graphics

Burger animates to an 'X' when selected.
Can be used to trigger menu slides.
Totally scalable and stylable with CSS.

## 2022-0216 - I'm still experimenting with this code!

I'm refactoring the HTML IDs to data attributes and 
experimenting with the Javascript code that triggers 
the event.

Currently, I'm toggling classes but I want to try 
using data attributes true/false to trigger the event.
This way when I need to trigger multiple events (ie.
for screen readers) I can do so easier and cleaner.
