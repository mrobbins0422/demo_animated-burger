# demo_animated_burger

basic animated hamburger icon with no graphics

# The Goal

To create an animated hamburger icon that toggles to an 'X' and back without the use of a graphics file.
Can be used to trigger menu slides.
Totally scalable and stylable with CSS.

## Scope Changes

Discovered the method I had been using was not semantically correct so I modified my code to be semantically correct and to take advantage of some built in features of HTML and CSS.  

## What I Learned  

Learned about the aria-expanded attribute and how it applies to button elements.  

[MDN Web Docs: aria-expanded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-expanded)  
[How to toggle aria-expanded](http://www.davidmacd.com/blog/toggle-aria-expanded-javascript.html)  

I found that HTML5 and CSS3 have new features that make them more interactive.  
I see a lot of code written in JavaScript to duplicate features that are now native to HTML 
and JavaScript.
This has caused me to reconsider how I write my code. In researching this project I 
found that writing semantically correct HTML makes it easier and more logical when I'm 
structuring my content.

## Future Research

I want to look into ARIA.

Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) is a set of attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities.  

[MDN Web Docs: ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA)  

Since MDN says 'no ARIA is better than bad ARIA', I will not be rushing to implement.
